How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  I can achieve this through early and frequent testing. Creating tests based around the program requirements will help ensure functionality. I can also review my code for syntax errors that may have been missed.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  When meeting with a client or gathering information from end users it is important to be as clear as possible. When creating the program requirements it is important to set priority levels and focus on meeting all requirements with proper functionality.

How do I approach designing software?
  I approach creating software with a quality focused mindset. It is important to focus on proper syntax and efficient code. When coding I stay focused on meeting requirements and testing early and often.
